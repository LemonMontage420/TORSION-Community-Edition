# TORSION Community Edition

## A Custom Vehicle Physics Implementation
TORSION CE is a custom vehicle physics implementation built using Unity and designed to teach users how to develop
their own real-time vehicle physics implementations within their own environments, whether it be Unity,
another game engine, or an environment like MATLAB.

* Straight up full custom vehicle physics for Unity that's easily scalable and ready to import into your own Unity project
* Understand the fundamental vehicle dynamic concepts that go into developing a real-time simulation
* Learn how to build TORSION from scratch with the accompanying YouTube tutorial series
* Join the Vehicle Physics Discord server and get access to VD papers, Git Repos, and a community of hundreds dedicated to vehicle physics development
